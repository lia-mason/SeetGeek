1 . Our team organized the documentations of the test cases by having seperate markdown files for the assigned specifications in a seperate branch for each team member. These were later merged to the master. 


2. The chosen testing framework tests the front end by using mocking to use a faked backend rather than actually running the backend. Functions will automatically fill in the elements and verification techniques such as assert statements will verify the correct execution took place. With GitHub Actions, we will be able to automatically run all our test cases directly on the cloud, whenever we make changes to  codebase. 


3. We are going to organize it by having a unique folder for each requirement specification. In each folder we will have a file for each of the many test cases of each requirement.
