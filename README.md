# IMPORTANT
# PLEASE DON'T MERGE ANYTHING TO MASTER UNTIL ITS YOUR FINAL DRAFT, especially the test summary.md. 

# ALSO MAKE SURE TO HAVE DONE THE FOLLOWING: 
1.
- Have your own markdown files in your branches.
- There is a sign that says pull request, click on it and click on create pull request. 
- Once you have made all the changes, merge the pull request to master.

2. 
- Go under amaar's branch, click on the TestSummary.md file and complete the table with the test cases you have done.
To create the table, use the link https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables. Copy the generated table to the TestSummary.md file at the bottom.
- Commit those changes to that branch, go to pull requests and merge the pull request to master only if its final
and it doesn't mess the file that is currently in master. 
- There are short answers at the bottom of that file, add stuff to it if necessary. 

Thanks :) 

Use following commands to get the tag name (only one person) :

while in master branch, open terminal and type: 

  git tag v0.0.4
  
  git push --tags

submit the tag name : v0.0.4 to ONQ and the pull request links for each member.
